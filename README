README file for DBIx::Broker

This Perl module provides a cleaner and more manageable API
to use for interaction with DBI-compatible databases.  Queries,
updates, inserts, counts, deletions, and even arbitrary SQL
statements can be executed in one line of top-level code, rather
than the usual three or four that contain that ugly ->prepare()
and ->execute() clutter.  SELECT row results may be retrieved
either all at once (returned as an array of hash/arrayrefs,
unless only one column's values are desired) or incrementally (a
hash/arrayref at a time).  It is also possible to print debugging
messages (the raw SQL statements) to any valid handle.

To install this module, use the standard Perl installation
procedure:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Then, to view the full documentation, type 

perldoc DBIx::Broker
